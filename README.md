This was developed for a fantasy hockey league in the 2016-2017 season. The league divided players into their countries, and you had to build a team using the NHL salary cap.

We tried a basic knapsack optimization method, for the Canadian team, based on their stats to that point in the season, since this league started in January. The league was scored on 10 various cateories (varying in offensive, defensive, and goaltending metrics) so we weighted these evenly.

The team went undefeated for the season.
